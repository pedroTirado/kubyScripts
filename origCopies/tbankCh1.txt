Feedback:  The selective theory says that, when an antigen receptor binds with an antigen, the cell becomes activated (or the cell is selected to proliferate and secrete more copies of the receptor). The instructional theory says that the antigen receptor molds itself to the antigen. The selective theory was shown to be correct.

Feedback:  Immune cells are actively migrating into the lymph node, and T and B cells within the node are proliferating via clonal selection and expansion. Collectively, these activities are contributing to swelling.

Feedback:  Two major functional differences exist when comparing the spleen to a lymph node. First, the spleen primarily reacts to antigens present in the blood, whereas lymph nodes react to lymph-borne antigens. Second, the spleen has well-defined functions not directly related to mounting an immune response including being a site where old and defective red blood cells are eliminated.








45.  You have discovered a potentially new leukocyte that appears to share a common progenitor with CD8+ T cells, lack antigen-specific receptors, do not participate in antigen presentation, and have a capacity for ADCC. Using knowledge of hematopoiesis, which cell type MOST closely resembles the potentially new leukocyte?
